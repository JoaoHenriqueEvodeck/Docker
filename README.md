# Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a platform for developers and sysadmins to develop, deploy, and run applications with containers. The use of Linux containers to deploy applications is called containerization. Containers are not new, but their use for easily deploying applications is.

Containerization is increasingly popular because containers are:

* Flexible: Even the most complex applications can be containerized.
* Lightweight: Containers leverage and share the host kernel.
* Interchangeable: You can deploy updates and upgrades on-the-fly.
* Portable: You can build locally, deploy to the cloud, and run anywhere.
* Scalable: You can increase and automatically distribute container replicas.
* Stackable: You can stack services vertically and on-the-fly.

### Images and containers

A container is launched by running an image. An image is an executable package that includes everything needed to run an application--the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files.

A container is a runtime instance of an image--what the image becomes in memory when executed (that is, an image with state, or a user process). You can see a list of your running containers with the command, docker ps, just as you would in Linux.

## Docker image set-up
